# x-user-archive-scraper

> Download and archive a complete Twitter/X user timeline using browser automation ‚Äî no API key required.

**x-archive-scraper** is a Python script that automates a logged-in browser session to scroll through a user's entire public tweet history on X (formerly Twitter), captures the underlying `SearchTimeline` GraphQL responses, and saves all tweet data in raw JSON format. It uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/) under the hood.



## üîç Why this project?

Twitter/X has:
- Deprecated free and public APIs
- Imposed strict rate limits on 3rd-party tools
- Limited access even for researchers and developers

This project bypasses these limitations by leveraging the browser's **actual network activity** ‚Äî just like a human would ‚Äî to download a user's full tweet history.



## ‚úÖ Features

- Uses your logged-in session ‚Äî **no API keys required**
- Captures **all tweets** (including replies, retweets, and quote tweets)
- Extracts from **`SearchTimeline` GraphQL requests** for maximum accuracy
- Saves each date range's raw response as JSON
- Scrolls the page automatically for reliable capture
- Works across long date ranges (e.g., entire account history)
- Supports persistent session storage (only login once)



## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Playwright

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install playwright python-dateutil
playwright install
```

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
python twitter_scraper.py
```

When first run:
* A browser window opens
* Login to your X (Twitter) account
* That session is saved for future use

Scraped tweet data will be saved in the captured_tweets/ folder.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
in ```twitter_scraper.py``` modify:

```py
USERNAME = "username"      # Twitter username
START_DATE = "2018-11-01"      # Start of scraping period
END_DATE = "2025-05-02"        # End of scraping period
SCROLL_DURATION_SEC = 30       # Scroll time per search, recommended 30s- if user's tweet frequency is high increase this time
```


## üìÅ Output Format
Each file corresponds to a 2-month period and contains raw GraphQL responses: (can be modified in code according to tweet frequency of the user)
```
captured_tweets/
  username_2018-11-01_to_2019-01-31.json
  username_2019-02-01_to_2019-04-30.json
  ...
```

Each JSON File contains:
```
[
  {
    "url": "...SearchTimeline...",
    "method": "GET",
    "post_data": null,
    "response": {
      "data": { ... },
      "timeline": { ... }
    }
  }
]
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Parser
A parser script is included to compile important fields from the user's tweet data and reduce the total garbage data.
The data retained includes:
```
tweet_id: The unique ID of the tweet (from rest_id).
user_screen_name: The screen name of the tweet author.
user_name: The display name of the tweet author.
user_id: The unique ID of the tweet author.
created_at: The timestamp when the tweet was created.
full_text: The complete text content of the tweet.
language: The language of the tweet (e.g., "en", "hi").
favorite_count: Number of likes the tweet received.
retweet_count: Number of retweets.
reply_count: Number of replies to this tweet.
quote_count: Number of times this tweet has been quoted.
source: The application used to post the tweet (e.g., "Twitter Web App").
is_reply: Boolean, true if this tweet is a reply to another.
reply_to_screen_name: If is_reply is true, the screen name of the user being replied to.
reply_to_tweet_id: If is_reply is true, the ID of the tweet being replied to.
is_quote: Boolean, true if this tweet quotes another tweet.
quoted_tweet_details: If is_quote is true, a dictionary containing:
tweet_id: ID of the quoted tweet.
user_screen_name: Screen name of the quoted tweet's author.
user_name: Display name of the quoted tweet's author.
created_at: Timestamp of the quoted tweet.
full_text: Text content of the quoted tweet.
favorite_count, retweet_count, reply_count, quote_count for the quoted tweet.
entities: A dictionary containing:
hashtags: List of hashtag texts.
user_mentions: List of mentioned user screen names.
urls: List of expanded URLs found in the twee
```
Outputs into:
```data_combined_tweets.json```

## üìå Limitations
* Private tweets or deleted content will not be accessible.
* To avoid being rate-limited, the script scrolls slowly (~30s per range).
* You must remain logged in, or reauthenticate once when prompted.
