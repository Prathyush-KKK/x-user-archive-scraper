# x-user-archive-scraper

> Download and archive a complete Twitter/X user timeline using browser automation ‚Äî no API key required.

**x-archive-scraper** is a Python script that automates a logged-in browser session to scroll through a user's entire public tweet history on X (formerly Twitter), captures the underlying `SearchTimeline` GraphQL responses, and saves all tweet data in raw JSON format. It uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/) under the hood.

---

## üîç Why this project?

Twitter/X has:
- Deprecated free and public APIs
- Imposed strict rate limits on 3rd-party tools
- Limited access even for researchers and developers

This project bypasses these limitations by leveraging the browser's **actual network activity** ‚Äî just like a human would ‚Äî to download a user's full tweet history.

---

## ‚úÖ Features

- Uses your logged-in session ‚Äî **no API keys required**
- Captures **all tweets** (including replies, retweets, and quote tweets)
- Extracts from **`SearchTimeline` GraphQL requests** for maximum accuracy
- Saves each date range's raw response as JSON
- Scrolls the page automatically for reliable capture
- Works across long date ranges (e.g., entire account history)
- Supports persistent session storage (only login once)

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Playwright

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install playwright python-dateutil
playwright install
```

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
python twitter_scraper.py
```

When first run:
* A browser window opens
* Login to your X (Twitter) account
* That session is saved for future use

Scraped tweet data will be saved in the captured_tweets/ folder.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
in ```twitter_scraper.py``` modify:

```py
USERNAME = "username"      # Twitter username
START_DATE = "2018-11-01"      # Start of scraping period
END_DATE = "2025-05-02"        # End of scraping period
SCROLL_DURATION_SEC = 30       # Scroll time per search, recommended 30s
```


## üìÅ Output Format
Each file corresponds to a 2-month period and contains raw GraphQL responses:
```
captured_tweets/
  username_2018-11-01_to_2019-01-31.json
  username_2019-02-01_to_2019-04-30.json
  ...
```

Each JSON File contains:
```
[
  {
    "url": "...SearchTimeline...",
    "method": "GET",
    "post_data": null,
    "response": {
      "data": { ... },
      "timeline": { ... }
    }
  }
]
```

## üìå Limitations
* Private tweets or deleted content will not be accessible.
* To avoid being rate-limited, the script scrolls slowly (~30s per range).
* You must remain logged in, or reauthenticate once when prompted.

## üõ°Ô∏è Legal Disclaimer
This tool is intended for personal archiving, research, and compliance purposes only. Use responsibly and in accordance with [Twitter's Terms of Service](https://twitter.com/en/tos).
